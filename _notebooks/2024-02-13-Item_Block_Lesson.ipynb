    "The first step to creating an object in this project is to give it a spritesheet and a canvas. Because the block should have collision with Mario, I decided to work in the \"Jump Platform\" sprite, because Mario already collides with the platform. In the \"Game Setup\" file, I added a new type of platform called \"Item Block\" with its own image, width, height, size and so on. Here is the asset data for the Block in \"Game Setup\"."

    "## Detecting the Player\n",
    "Now that the item block exists in the game world, we need to give it collision to allow the block to detect Mario. Currently, mario has code that can detect he collides with a platform, but the platform does not have code to detect when it collides with Mario. In order for the item block to react to Mario and activate, we need to make sure that the platform is running collision checks. The collision checks are handled by the Game Object class, which the Jump Platform extends. In the Jump Platform file, I added the collision checks function to the update function which runs code from the Game Object class to detect whether the hitboxes of two objects are overlapping. Then, I added a collision action function and some if statements that make it so that the block only activates when collding with Mario."

    "I also needed to make a simple spritesheet for a visual cue that the block has been activated. The spritesheet below has two sprites, one unactivated and one activated. The sprite is controlled by the relative x variable. In the draw function, one of the parameters to be passed in is the x position of the top left corner of the image to be drawn. By changing this value, we can shift the image so a different sprite is showing on the canvas. This is one of the effects triggered when Mario jumps on the block."

    "## Random Event Handler\n",
    "The other thing that is triggered by the item block is a random event. The Game Control file is where many of the universal triggers and settings are such as the timer and game speed, so its a good place for the random event handler. When the item block is triggered, it runs the start game event function from Game Control. This sets two variables that are held in the Game Contol file. The first variable is random event state, which is set to one when the event is triggered. Next, the variable random event state is set to a random integer between one and three to decide which random event is triggered. Then, whatever object needs to react to the random event will detect it, then end the random event by triggering the end random event function in Game Control (setting the random event state variable back to 0). The generic code for random event detection is below."
